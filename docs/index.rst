What is captest?
================

Captest is intended to facilitate capacity testing following ASTM E2848.
The captest module contains a single class, CapData, which provides
methods for loading, visualizing, filtering, and regressing capacity
testing data. The module also includes functions that take CapData
objects as arguments and provide summary data and capacity test results.

Please see the Jupyter notebooks in the examples directory, which
include examples of the core features.


Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.
