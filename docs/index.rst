==========================================

Captest is intended to facilitate capacity testing following ASTM E2848 - Standard
Test Method for Reporting Photovoltaic Non-Concentrator System Performance.
The captest module contains a single class, CapData, which provides
methods for loading, visualizing, filtering, and regressing capacity
testing data. The module also includes functions that take CapData
objects as arguments and provide summary data and capacity test results.

You can download the `presentation <https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/download/7353/>`_
introducing pvcaptest at the PVPMC modeling workshop this past May.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

An example of a complete capacity test using captest is available in the examples
section. The examples are all produced from Jupyter notebooks and an interactive
version can be launched by clicking on the 'launch binder' button.  

This project is under active development with a goal of releasing a v1.0 with a stable API.
Please see the `github page <https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest>`_ for the
source code. Ongoing work is tracked in the Github projects and issues.  If you
have suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please open an issue.
